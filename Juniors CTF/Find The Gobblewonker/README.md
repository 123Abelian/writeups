# Find The Gobblewonker
#### 100 Points

### Problem
Do you want to find yourself on an island with monsters? 
Here are coordinates of it 10.0.17.131 
But it`s not as easy as it seems. You need a boat. 
You will find the boat there: https://scoreboard.ctf.org.ru/vpn/YOU_TEAM_TOKEN.7z 

You`ll need this boat for travelling to the other islands. Fair winds and following seas!

### Description
We first need to get the ovpn files by going to the link.
Afterwards, we run the opvn file.

```sudo openvpn JuniorsCTF_2016_SST_CTF_1.ovpn```

We now have access to their system. After going to the page 10.0.17.131, we get the flag.
